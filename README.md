# Summary
This small module was created for my own need!

You can't easily send functions through pipes so that's how this
little module came to gather by hacking the functions ```__code__``` attributum

It automaticly changes out the classes ```__init__``` function and your defined functions.

# TODO
- add special case funtions list to be changed out
